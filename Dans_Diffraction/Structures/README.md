# Dans_Diffraction
## Structure Files
A selection of CIF and mCIF files for use as examples in Dans_Diffraction.

Structure files are from a range of sources including online databases, publications and many are generated by the
author using a range of software. 

Most of the structures are in no way related to the author and are provided as
useful examples. These files are not covered by the package copyright, please see individual files and sources for references.

### Instructions
```text
$ ipython -i -m Dans_Diffraction
```

```python
>> import Dans_Diffraction as dif
>> print(dif.structure_list.list) # display all available files
>> xtl = dif.structure_list.Diamond() # create crystal object
>> xtl.info() # print Crystal structure parameters
```

### CIF & mCIF
Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) are the standard definition of crystalline structures used in crystallography.
A variant on these, mCIF, are used to define magnetic structures.

### Datasources
The files are downloaded or generated from a range of data sources, for example:

* [ICSD](https://icsd.products.fiz-karlsruhe.de/)
* [AMCSD](http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/amcsd.php)
* [MAGNDATA](http://webbdcrista1.ehu.es/magndata/)
* [ISODISTORT](https://stokes.byu.edu/iso/isodistort.php)
