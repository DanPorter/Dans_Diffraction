# Operation
From version 3.2, installing Dans_Diffraction will include a run script for the gui:
```text
$ dansdiffraction
```
Alternatively, Dans_Diffraction is best run within an interactive python environment:
```text
$ ipython -i -m Dans_Diffraction
```

Dans_Diffraction can also be run in scripts as an import, example scripts are provided in the [Examples](https://github.com/DanPorter/Dans_Diffraction/blob/master/Examples) folder.
### Read CIF file
```python
import Dans_Diffraction as dif
xtl = dif.Crystal('some_file.cif')
xtl.info() # print Crystal structure parameters
help(xtl)  # all functions (nearly!) are documented
```

### Alter atomic positions
```python
xtl.Cell.latt([2.85,2.85,10.8,90,90,120]) #  set lattice parameters
xtl.Atoms.info() # Print Symmetric positions
xtl.Structure.info() # Print All positions in P1 symmetry (same structure and functions as xtl.Atoms)
# Symmetric positions
xtl.Atoms.changeatom(idx=0, u=0, v=0, w=0, type='Co', label='Co1')
xtl.Atoms.addatom(idx=0, u=0, v=0, w=0, type='Co', label='Co1')
# After adding or changing an atom in the Atoms class, re-generate the full structure using symmetry arguments:
xtl.generate_lattice()
# Full atomic structure in P1 symmetry
xtl.Structure.changeatom(idx=0, u=0, v=0, w=0, type='Co', label='Co1')
xtl.Structure.addatom(idx=0, u=0, v=0, w=0, type='Co', label='Co1')
# Plot crystal Structure
xtl.Plot.plot_crystal() # 3D plot
xtl.Plot.plot_layers() # 2D plot for layered materials
```
![3D Plot](https://github.com/DanPorter/Dans_Diffraction/blob/master/Screenshots/3Dstructrue_Ca3CoMnO6.png?raw=true)


### Alter crystal symmetry
```python
xtl.Symmetry.info() # print symmetry arguments
xtl.Symmetry.addsym('x,y,z+1/2') # adds single symmetry operation
xtl.Symmetry.changesym(0, 'x,y,z+1/4')
xtl.Symmetry.load_spacegroup(194) # replaces current symmetry operations
# After adding or changing symmetry operations, regengerate the symmetry matrices
xtl.Symmetry.generate_matrices()
```

### Save structure as CIF
Lattice parameters, crystal structure and symmetry operations will be saved to the CIF.
If magnetic moments are defined, magnetic symmetry operations and moments will also be saved
and format changed to "*.mcif".
```python
xtl.write_cif('edited file.cif')
```

### Calculate Structure Factors
X-ray or neutron structure factors/ intensities are calculated based on the full unit cell structure, including atomic 
form-factors (x-rays) or coherent scattering lengths (neutrons).
```python
# Choose scattering options (see help(xtl.Scatter.setup_scatter))
xtl.Scatter.setup_scatter(type='x-ray', energy_keV=8.0)
# Allowed radiation types:
#    'xray','neutron','xray magnetic','neutron magnetic','xray resonant'
xtl.Scatter.print_all_refelctions() # Returns formated string of all allowed reflections
inten = xtl.Scatter.intensity([h,k,l]) # Returns intensity
twotheta, iten, reflections = xtl.Scatter.powder(units='twotheta')
# Plot Experimental Intensities
xtl.Plot.simulate_powder() # Powder pattern
xtl.Plot.simulate_hk0() # Reciprocal space plane
```

### Magnetic Structrues
*Magnetic structures and scattering are currently in development and shouldn't be treated as accurate!*

Simple magnetic structures can be loaded from magnetic cif (*.mcif) files. Magnetic moments are stored for each atomic 
position as a vector. The crystal object has a seperate set of magnetic symmetry operations. Symmetry operations from the 
tables of magnetic spacegroups can also be loaded. Only simple magnetic structures are allowed. There must be the same
number of magnetic symmetry operations as crystal symmetry operations and atomic positions can only have single moments
assigned.
```python
xtl = dif.Crystal('some_file.mcif')
xtl.Atoms.mxmymz() # return magnetic moment vectors on each ion
xtl.Symmetry.symmetry_operations_magnetic # magnetic symmetry operations (list of strings)
xtl.Symmetry.print_magnetic_spacegroups() # return str of available magnetic spacegroups, given crystal's spacegroup
xtl.Symmetry.load_magnetic_spacegroup(mag_spg_number) # loads mag. operations given mag. spacegroup number
```
Magnetic scattering is also available for neutrons and x-rays (both resonant and non-resonant), using the appropriate magnetic form-factors.
```python
Imag = xtl.Scatter.magnetic_neutron(HKL=[0,0,3])
Ires = xtl.Scatter.xray_resonant_magnetic(HKL=[0,0,3], energy_kev=2.838, azim_zero=[1, 0, 0], psi=0, polarisation='s-p', F0=0, F1=1, F2=0)
```

### Superstructures
Superstructures can be built using the Superstructure class, requring only a matrix to define the new phase:
```python
su = xtl.generate_superstructure([[2,0,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,1]])
```

Superstucture classes behave like Crystal classes, but have an additional 'Parent' property that references the original 
crystal structure and additional behaviours partiular to superstructures. Superstructures loose their parent crystal and
magnetic symmetry, always being defined in P1 symmetry. So su.Atoms == su.Structure.

```python
print(su.parent.info())  # Parent structure
su.P # superstructure matrix 
su.superhkl2parent([h, k, l])  # index superstructure hkl with parent cell
su.parenthkl2super([h, k, l])  # index parent hkl with supercell
```

### Multi-phase
Scattering from different crystal structures can be compared using the MultiCrystal class:
```python
xtls = xtl1 + xtl2
xtls.simulate_powder()
```


### Properties
The Crystal class contains a lot of atomic properties that can be exposed in the Properties class:
```python
xtl.Properties.info()
```

Calculated properties include:
 - Molecular weight
 - Density
 - Diamagnetic suscpetibility 
 - x-ray absorption coefficient, attenuation length, transmission and refractive index
 - Molecular charge balance
 - Molecular mass fraction
 - Atomic orbitals
 - Magnetic exchange paths (in progress...)

Properties are calulated using the atomic structure along with atomic data stored in the folder [Dans_Diffraction/data](data).


### Multiple Scattering
Simulations of multiple scattering at different azimuths for a particular energy can be simulated. Based on [code by Dr Gareth Nisbet](https://journals.iucr.org/a/issues/2015/01/00/td5022/).
 [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.12866.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12866).

```python
azimuth, intensity = xtl.Scatter.ms_azimuth([h,k,l], energy_kev=8)
```

### Graphical Front End
![All GUI elements](https://github.com/DanPorter/Dans_Diffraction/blob/master/Screenshots/GUI_all.png?raw=true)

Start a new GUI, then select a cif file:
```text
$ ipython -i -m Dans_Diffraction gui
```
Or start the GUI from within the interactive console:
```python
dif.start_gui()
```
Using an already generated crystal:
```python
xtl.start_gui()
```

### Diffractometer Simulator
![Diffractometer](https://github.com/DanPorter/Dans_Diffraction/blob/master/Screenshots/diffractometer.png?raw=true)

New in version 3.0.0. Simulate a generic detector situated around the crystal sample, with the ability to 
control detector location shape and size and lattice orientation.


### FDMNES functionality
FDMNES is a powerful tool for simulating resonant x-ray diffraction, created by [Y. Joly and O. Bunau.](https://fdmnes.neel.cnrs.fr/)

The Dans_Diffraction FDMNES class allows for the automatic creation of input files and simple analysis of results.
The following command should be used to activate these features (only needs to be issued once). 
```python
dif.activate_fdmnes()
```
Once activated, the FDMNES classes become available.
```python
fdm = dif.Fdmnes(xtl) # Create input files and run FDMNES
fdma = dif.FdmnesAnalysis(output_path, output_name) # Load output files and plot results
```
See class documentation for more information.


Once activated, FDMNES GUI elements become available from the main window, emulating functionality of the classes.
